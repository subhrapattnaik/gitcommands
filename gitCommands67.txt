git init   -- Intialize your repository with Git and Git starts tracking changes in your files 
git add [file name]  -- Add a file (changes from your working directory to a staging area)
git commit -m "any message"  -- Commit a file to commit history  
git remote add [remote repository name] [remote url address]  -- Connect your local repository to a remote repository
git push  -- Push the current local repository to remote
git clone [url]  -- Clone the remote repository into a local repository  
mkdir [folder name] -- Creates a new directory
git status -- After doing the changes this command shows the file names which are modified

Git divides our work into 3 stages

1.Working Directory (Where we are creating and making changes to our file)

We do (git add file name)

2.Staging Area (When the files are ready to be commited)

We do (git commit -m "any message")
 
3.Local Git Repository (After the files are comitted, they become part of commit history in a local repository)

We do (git push)

4. There is a remote repository where we can push all our work

(git pull) is used to get the file from remote repository to local repository

git diff --staged (shows the difference between the working directory and the previous commits)
git log (shows all your commits with the commit no.)
git checkout [commit id] -- (commit ID is the first 5 character of the ID)
git branch -- shows all the branches in your local repository
git checkout [branch name] -- (to switch to a particular branch) 
git branch [branch name] -- (to create a new branch)
git diff [branchA] [branchB] -- (to see the differences between the branches)
 
git remote add origin [http...git] -- (empty repository URL)
git push origin master

By default the branch is master
